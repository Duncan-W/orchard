            It is important to continue to operate even after the event is carried through. Create continuity and credibility by completing the post-event tasks immediately after the event. Post-event management includes thank you notes and feedback, photos and news, website, and network updates, analysing the event result, event reporting and financial management.

            <p class="paragraph-header">Thank you note.</p>
            <p class="paragraph-content">
                A thank you note is a great way to acknowledge all who contributed to the event and who experienced it. Send the thank you notes as soon as possible after the event, even on the same night, right after the event. Recipients may include guests, speakers, performers, event staff, sponsors, and collaborators.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph-header">Follow-up.</p>
            <p class="paragraph-content">
                Continue the event lifecycle, impact, and guest engagement by sharing videos, trailers, webinars, and/or pictures on the web shortly after the event. Highlights may be shared on social media. Offer the material to your stakeholders as well. Decide on the date for next years' event and share it as an early reminder or send a save-the-date invitation.

            <p class="paragraph-header">Feedback.</p>
            <p class="paragraph-content">
                Decide whom you wish to have feedback from, whether it is participants, volunteers, working group, sponsors, donors etc. Create questionnaires on Teams for each group. Send the feedback form soon (one hour to one day) after the event while the event is still fresh in the attendee's mind. Set a deadline for when to answer by the latest.

            <p class="paragraph-header">Post-event session.</p>
            <p class="paragraph-content">
                Conduct a team debrief to learn each other's thoughts. Ask the critical questions: Did we meet the objective of the event? Where did we succeed? What can we do to make it better next time? Cover the key functions: registration, set-up, programme, catering, signage/decor, guest relations, etc. Create a relaxed environment where people are comfortable sharing their thoughts to improve future events.

                Depending on how the event has been monitored, you are able to analyse the outcome by evaluating the number of attendees, feedback, budget, collaboration, media visibility, etc.
