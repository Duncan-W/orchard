                <p class="paragraph-content">
                    The format of your event refers to how you deliver your content and facilitate interaction among your attendees. This can be in-person, virtual or hybrid. You can choose from a variety of formats, such as multi-day conferences, keynote speeches, panel discussions, workshops, breakout sessions, Q&A sessions, networking events amongst others. Choose the format that best meets your objectives for your event and is realistic in terms of time and budget so that you can increase your probability of success.
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph-header">In-person</p>
                <p class="paragraph-content">  
                    Audience and guests arrive to a given place at a given time. High interaction and possibility to network on the spot. Requires a host and several people to assist. Examples include multi-day conferences, seminars, lecture series, receptions.
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph-header">Virtual</p>
                <p class="paragraph-content">
                    Interaction is limited to e.g. chat. Usually one way communication. The full programme is viewed from any location on a screen. Requires moderator(s) and hosts.
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph-header">Hybrid</p>
                <p class="paragraph-content">
                    Event format combining the online experience with the in-person participation. Both formats run parallel and are equally valued. The differences of content should be clear to audience whether you are taking part online or in-person. Requires staff for both online and in-person productions e.g. hosts, assistants, moderators, and AV production.

                <p class="paragraph-header">Closed vs Public Event</p>
                <p class="paragraph-content">
                    In the context of IADT internal closed events and public events generally differ in terms of audience accessibility and participation: <br><br>

                    <b>Closed Event.</b> <br>
                    Will have restricted access. They are only open to a select group of people, such as IADT students, faculty, staff, or invited guests. These events may require an invitation, registration, or affiliation with the institution. Examples include internal workshops, student exhibitions restricted to the IADT community, private screenings, or department meetings. <br><br>

                    <b>Public Event.</b> <br>
                    Accessible to the general public, including people who are not part of IADT. Anyone interested, including members of the public or people from other institutions, can attend without specific invitations. Though it is recommended to have a registration form even if the event is free. Examples would include public exhibitions, open lectures, cultural festivals, or screenings where anyone is welcome to participate.

                    What is the cost estimate? Who oversees the budget? List your estimated income and all your expenses, both fixed and variable costs. There are always variable costs which depend on the number of participants, e.g. catering. Fixed costs will not change no matter how many participants arrive, these include AV, staffing, venue hire, marketing. <br>
                    If the event is recurring, familiarise yourself with the budgets from previous events. Always aim to keep the costs reasonable through good and solid planning. <br> For unexpected costs a 5-10% contingency in the budget is recommended. <br>
                    When getting quotes for your budget, remember to adhere to the IADT procurement policy. <br>

                    The owner of the event should provide the correct Sub Account code references for where the funding to pay for the event will come from. Make sure that the event has a budget and has a Sub Account code on Agresso. 

                    <ul>
                        <li>For internal smaller events funded by a department use the relevant department D-code.</li>

                    Plan and find out what resources exist and what can be utilised from within IADT. Things like technical solutions, venue, and cleaning should be clearly stated in the budget. Some products and services might need to be ordered from external suppliers. Consider the need for extra staff.

                <p class="paragraph-header">Payment Methods</p>
                <p class="paragraph-content">
                    Where possible it is preferrable to collect income by credit card as invoicing is a resource intensive activity. When using credit cards there is an additional surcharge that the provider charges per transaction. This will need to be absorbed in your budget.

                <p class="paragraph-content">
                    When organising large events, especially conferences, external funding and partners might be involved in the form of co-organisers (e.g. DLR, Failte Ireland offers support for Association Conferences <!-- click here for more information <- that is a link to somewhere -->), sponsors or as umbrella organisations (e.g. EU, professional associations). All partners should agree to the Code of Conduct. External funding can also be in the form of grants. Contact <!-- Finance <- Another link to somewhere --> to raise an invoice for external funding.

                <p class="paragraph-header">Sponsorship and the benefits of Sponsorship</p>
                <p class="paragraph-content">
                    There are three basic types of sponsorship: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Provision of goods or services in-kind: where goods or services are provided either without charge or at a significantly discounted price in return for some kind of association with the event</li>
                        <li>Working in Partnership: where the parties agree to fund or arrange a joint event, usually on a cost sharing basis.</li>
                        <li>Financial support: where a cash contribution is made in return for some kind of association with the event or an activity </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph-header">Internal Approval and Aggreements.</p>
                <p class="paragraph-content">
                    All sponsorship agreements must be signed by the Secretary/Financial Controller.
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph-header">Types of Benefit.</p>
                <p class="paragraph-content">
                    It is reasonable for sponsors to expect some return for their support and such returns should be confined to the event itself. Benefits usually fall into one of four categories:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Branding: The association of a company name and/or logo on promotional material. The prominence and extent of a sponsor's logo should reflect the value of sponsorship funding, especially when working in partnership with a sponsor.</li>
                        <li>Accreditation: The direct association of the sponsor's name with an activity. Sponsors should not be offered accreditation within the title of the activity, as this might imply ownership.</li>
                        <li>Showcasing: The association of a company's products or services through exhibition or use. Examples would include allowing a company to set up a display stand at an event or using a company's products to support an event.</li>
                        <li>Representation: The allocation of places/tickets to sponsors for attendance at activities.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph-header">Sponsorship</p>
                <p class="paragraph-content">
                    Careful consideration should always be given to the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sponsorship arrangements must not compromise the dignity or public standing of the IADT.</li>
                        <li>Its best practice to review and discuss review sponsorship agreements with Head of Department and for them to be signed by the Secretary/Financial Controller.</li>
                        <li>Sponsorship must be for the event, not of IADT or staff.</li>
                        <li>Sponsorship should not imply endorsement by IADT.</li>
                        <li>Sponsorship should not place staff under undue obligation.</li>
                    </ul>

                    Any sponsorship should add to, and not detract from, the value of the event.
                    When considering potential sponsors, you should take care to avoid unethical associations (i.e. companies that may have had their image tarnished and, therefore, have low credibility in the eyes of the public and media) or conflicts of interest and you should consider how the various target audiences may perceive the commercial involvement.   
                    Be aware that sponsorship by companies in some product industry areas could impact negatively, for example: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Alcohol and tobacco Industry.</li>
                        <li>Defence Industry.</li>
                        <li>Environmentally unsound companies.</li>
                        <li>Companies with political or religious connections, and those giving substantial political donations.</li>
                        <li>Companies likely to try to use the activity as a market to sell products.</li>
                        <li>Companies undergoing Government or financial investigation.</li>
                        <li>Companies in contractual negotiations or arrangements to provide particular goods or services to IADT.</li>
                    </ul>

                    In any sponsorship arrangement there is a requirement for a formal agreement so that the responsibilities of both parties are clearly defined.

                    Corporate Sponsorship Agreement (PDF) example <!-- 'Create an example' look into it further -->

                    In some cases, sponsors' motives or the benefits that the sponsor anticipates may not be immediately apparent so it is important to document what a sponsor might gain from the agreement.  The agreement should set out the benefits on offer to each party, any renewal rights, exclusivity, financial arrangements, facilities for dispute resolution and a termination clause. Consult your Head of Department and <!-- "Finance" Another link to somehere --> for approval.
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph-header">VAT</p>
                <p class="paragraph-content">
                    In IADT all cost calculation, and budgets are done excluding VAT, both income and expenses. Where the primary purpose of the event is strictly to provide education/vocational training only, the registration/admission fees are exempt events from charging VAT. <!-- "See Revenue for more details." Another link to somewhere --> Events for the general public should include VAT, even if the event itself is free of charge, especially when invoiced from participants/funders. <!-- "Consult Finance" Another link to somewhere --> for details.

                <p class="paragraph-content">
                    An event is never solely a one-person effort, but always requires partners and people involved. Before you begin, ensure that you have adequate assistance to plan and run the event. Duties and responsibilities should be clearly assigned. Decide early on what channels of communication are used within the working group, as this helps keeping the process clear for everyone included. Depending on the scope of the event, the operational resources and roles may vary. Larger events will require dedicated staff to oversee registrations, answer queries and manage the requirements of speakers and VIPs. On the day, you will need to plan to have staff to look after registration desks, usher guests to seats, greet speakers and ensure the safety of everyone attending the event.

                <summary>Running order for event management</summary>
                List all the things you should consider and put them in your worksheet. A checklist is needed for the month running towards the event and the second is the running order for the day with what needs to happen when. The working group should have access to the worksheet and running order e.g. through Teams. You can use the checklist template, found in the Templates section of this Event Toolkit.

                <p class="paragraph-header">Create a Running Order</p>
                <p class="paragraph-content">
                    This will ensure that you have thought through the details. It ensures that you have thought about the timing of your event/ seminar/ meetings and have built in enough time for breaks, social connections, and travel. It also ensures that you have thought through when items need to be delivered, when assistants need to be onsite and where they need to be.
                    It should include all the tasks associated with getting the event up and running, giving details on access timings, the set up/take down, event timings,locations and responsibilities.
                    Break your event duration down into hours, or 30-minute slots, so that it is easier to allocate chunks of time to different activities.
                    Begin by determining the overall event duration, this will allow you to fix on times for speaker sessions, networking, and breakout sessions.
                    List your plenary and breakout sessions.
                    Make a list of all the activities you need to fit into your event.
                    List your stakeholders, key visitors, partners, and sponsors, to ensure their requirements are being adequately met.

                    <p class="ul-title">When putting together your Running Order, ensure you take into account the following: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Allow enough time for guests to get to your event - if your event is in the evening, allow enough time for visitors to get from their workplace to the event venue.</li>
                        <li>Ensure your timing and dates fit and that the location is a good fit with your audience, i.e. certain industries, and audiences and diary clashes.</li>
                        <li>Ensure there are regular breaks in the programme to keep your guests engaged. You could also consider getting guests to change locations at various points in the day.</li>
                        <li>Provide regular and adequate refreshment breaks to allow for networking.</li>
                        <li>You may want to include “free space” for activities such as networking, visiting, or learning about a resource or project that IADT is currently running, you might find it valuable to invite other colleagues to spend time or meet a visiting cohort.</li>
                        <li>For screenings, exhibitions, remember to check timings.</li>

                <p class="paragraph-content">
                    What is the actual timeline and schedule for the event, include introductions, speakers, panels, entertainment, and transitions (e.g. movement time for attendees to move from one location to another), to compile the entire event schedule. Include time for breaks and transitions and add time for engagement and interaction. Remember, do not make sessions too long.

                    <p class="ul-title">Points to consider:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Do the different event components (sessions, social activities, pauses, etc) flow naturally from one to another?</li>
                        <li>Keep interest levels up - leave your 'biggest ticket' for the end.</li>
                        <li>Try and vary the nature and length of sessions, so you are managing the energy of the event.</li>
                        <li>If you have more than one person doing similar activities or talking about similar topics, consider having them join forces in one session.</li>
                        <li>If you're having a seated audience listening to a speaker, bear in mind that people will generally tire of listening to someone for more than 30 to 45 minutes, and build in an extra 15 minutes for Q&As.</li>
                        <li>Plan regular breaks to allow participants to get refreshments and re-energise. This is most important when delivering a virtual event, people spend a lot of time on their screens, make sure you factor in enough time for them to step away and take a break from technology. </li>
                        <li>If you are organising a high-level invite-only networking dinner, make sure there is a designated individual performing the role of host. They will be the person managing the flow to the evening, allowing a mix of informal and relaxed moments - where guests can talk to each other at ease, with some other more formal moments where the headline guest can be drawn into conversation with the table under the host's chairing.</li>
