                Event production refers to a professionally managed and well-coordinated process in which the arrangements and elements are brought together in order to deliver a functional and impressive event within the given time and budget frame. The following sections help you consider what needs to be booked and settled prior to the event. Things to take into consideration include e.g. choosing venue, coordinating the programme and speakers, staffing, catering, transport, accessibility, sustainability.

                    Identify the availability, accessibility, and size of the venue for the anticipated attendance and programme. Check how the facilities are equipped with technology, furniture, and restrooms. Always consider enough time for the setup, the event itself, and the disassembly and clean-up.

                    Room layout can be in theatre, classroom, rounds, cabaret, boardroom, u-shape. The layout can greatly effect the capacity of the room. It also takes a long time to change the layout. If the layout does need to be changed, build in extra time into your room booking. Outline the layout required when submitting your event notification to Estates + Facilities. <br>

                <p class="paragraph-content">
                    The venues in IADT are available from hire. There are different rates depending on the association with IADT:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>IADT Staff</b> - most rooms and spaces at IADT can be booked free of charge. This is on the understanding that events relate to work of the community of IADT; e.g. connect to its programmes, and strategic priorities. The only venue where this may differ is Carnegie where fees may apply. Please contact the <!-- "events team" Link -->.</li>
                        <li><b>Event is organised by IADT but paid by an external party</b> - community rates apply. Bookings must be directed to the relevant contact for the venue (see point on booking the event venue). An example of this would be if you were personally funded through grant aid, this is generally considered external to IADT, or if you were running an event for a society or group you are associated with but it is not an IADT event.</li>
                        <li><b>Not-for profit organisations</b> - Community rates apply.</li>
                        <li><b>External organisations</b> - if the event is organised by anyone external to IADT, rental charges apply. In these cases contact roombooking@iadt.ie </li> <!-- Link -->

                    The most challenging time to find facilities during the year are the end of August and first week of September and the end of April to end of June. <br>
                    As far as possible the institute does not welcome events running alongside major institutional events, (e.g. OnShow), unless is it has been agreed by the Executive. Please refer to the Academic Calendar. <br>

                    Prior to the event, the event organiser must always send the Estates + Facilities team a 'notification of facility use', assistance required and event security. For small events, a minimum of two weeks' notice should be given. Larger events, six weeks prior notice is required. This guideline applies to all events organised at IADT except for virtual events or normal semester lectures. The form must be sent to caretakersdesk@iadt.ie. <br> <!-- Link -->

                <p class="paragraph-header">Content Creation.</p>
                <p class="paragraph-content">
                    Consider what content adds value to the objective of the event and enhances the engagement of the audience. Consider various ways of presenting the content in a motivating format for your audience. Think about a suitable name for the event and its content with consideration to continuity and formalities. Use a consistent theme throughout the programme elements. Check how much of the content can be resourced from within IADT and how much needs to be booked from outside. 
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph-header">Speakers, hosts, facilitators.</p>
                <p class="paragraph-content">
                    Keynote speakers and hosts need to be approached well in advance. The owner of the event usually sends the invitation to the key speakers. Consider IADT community specialists to take the role of a host, chair, moderator, facilitator or MC. Give consideration to the diversity of any speakers, facilitators, panellists and similar positions that are being invited to your event. Questions to ask yourself can include: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Are they representative in terms of gender? </li>
                        <li>Are they representative in terms of race/ethnicity?</li>
                        <li>Are they representative in terms of age and/or career stage?</li>
                        <li>Are they representative in terms of disability?</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph-header">Protocol.</p>
                <p class="paragraph-content">
                    If you anticipate attendance by any VIPs or dignitaries at your event, it is important to ensure that relevant institute stakeholders (e.g. the President's Office, Estates + Facilities, Marketing etc.) are aware. If you are made aware at a later stage in the planning process of the likely attendance of VIP guests or dignitaries at your event, <!-- "please notify Marketing" Link -->.

                <p class="paragraph-header">Speakers communication.</p>
                <p class="paragraph-content">
                    Speakers will need separate communication to regular attendees. Some may be seasoned presenters, and others may be nervous. Provide as much information as possible in advance. <br>
                    Presentor guidelines <!-- Link -->
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph-header">Speakers prep time.</p>
                <p class="paragraph-content">
                    Make sure you build-in time (15 minutes approximately) for speakers to meet with AV support staff, to set up microphones and run through how they work. If the event is being recorded, speakers will need briefing on camera positions and audio setup. How they interact with the technology will affect the end result.
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph-header">Presentations.</p>
                <p class="paragraph-content">
                    If there are presentations, audio and oral materials, make sure you have the materials set up in advance, so they're uploaded, checked and ready to go. Request them from presenters in advance and save into folders and clearly label them for the AV team. <br>
                    For events with a degree of complexity - more than just presentations - schedule a run through in the venue you've booked. If you're not sure if that applies to your event speak to the Events Team. IADT has limited capacity for AV support but will consider requests on a case-by-case basis. Consider having a laptop available where speakers can upload their presentations if they have not sent them in advance.
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph-header">Speakers Photos & Bios.</p>
                <p class="paragraph-content">
                    When a presenter agrees, request a photo and bio which can be uploaded to the website and promotional information. Ensure that the speaker agrees to this.  
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph-header">Social events.</p>
                <p class="paragraph-content">
                    For larger conferences, include enough free time and breaks, including selected points of interest such as museums, sightseeing, tours or excursions. For inspiration and options. <!-- "VisitDublin.com" "DLRTourism.ie" Two Links -->

For larger purchases from non-procured partners one should always request quotations from 3 vendors before choosing a provider. For small daily items no purchase process is applied but bare in mind the actual need.

                    When planning your event, think carefully about what food and/or drink you would like to give to your guests and where this will be served. It is important to set expectations before the guests arrive; in the additional information that you send out, let guests know if and when they will be given food or drink so that they know what to expect when they arrive. <br>
                    You can also advise them of the facilities available on campus if you are not going to be providing refreshments. Where food is being provided, you should ensure that you give guests the opportunity to advise of any special dietary or allergy requirements.

                    To get a well-planned catering quotation, provide at least the following information: date and location, event and catering format (breakfast, lunch, dinner, cocktail, easy-going, formal, etc.), an estimated scheduled time for the serving, an estimated range of participants (min and max), budget range, food and drink preferences (e.g. vegan, vegetarian, gluten free, oat milk). When you place the order, ask when the caterer needs your final confirmation (number of participants, special diets) since this is important information for your production schedule.

                    If you add a hotel option for your guests to book and pay directly, remember to agree a quotation price with the hotel(s) beforehand. The deadline of the hotel quota(s) and the deadline for the event registration should always be the same. Try where possible to arrange for a booking code with the hotel for attendees to use when booking, rather than having to manage the accommodation yourself. <!-- "Contact Events" Link --> for support if required.

                    The organiser is always responsible for ensuring that the event is planned and implemented in such a way that people can participate safely, and so that the arrangements are functional even if something unexpected should happen. How to minimise risks and ensure safety of an event should be discussed well in advance. Number of participants, the time of the event, layout of the venue etc. all play a significant role in the safety of people.

For small events, a minimum of two weeks' notice should be given. Larger events, six weeks prior notice is required. This guideline applies to all events organised at IADT except for virtual events or normal semester lectures. The form must be sent to <!-- "caretakersdesk@iadt.ie" Link -->. <br>

The Event Safety Policy details all the steps that you must take to ensure appropriate Health and Safety precautions are taken throughout your event. When planning your event, the following aspects of Health and Safety may need to be considered, depending on the size and scale of your event. The points below are intended to offer only a brief summary - please ensure that you refer to the full Policy in advance of your event to familiarise yourself with all your responsibilities.

                <p class="paragraph-header">Risk Assessments.</p>
                <p class="paragraph-content">
                    It is essential that a suitable risk assessment detailing the arrangements for reasonably foreseeable risk is created for your event. Your risk assessment should include contingencies to deal with incidents and situations as varied as contractors cancelling at short notice, severe weather, or the unavailability of key staff in your team. You will also need to consider the response to more serious emergencies, including major incidents that will require help from the emergency services and implementation of their emergency plans. <br>
                    You should ensure appropriate management systems are in place for each phase of the event to make sure health and safety risks are controlled. <br>
                    While the numbers onsite during the 'public' period will be significantly greater, the need for safety management during build up, load-in, breakdown and load-out is just as important as this is likely to be when the highest-risk work activities are carried out. <br>
                    Sample Risk Assessment <!-- Link? --> <br>
                    All external contractors must compile separate risk assessments for their work, a method statement for the installation of any temporary structures and make available a copy of their third-party liability insurance.  
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph-header">First Aid</p>
                <p class="paragraph-content">
                    The level of First Aid provision you will need at your event will depend on the numbers attending, the profile of the audience and the type of event. This should be detailed in the Risk Assessment for your event. For smaller events, it may be sufficient to ensure some of the staff working at the event are trained in first aid but for larger events, it may be necessary to book First Aid provision from a recognised provider. A number of voluntary organisations will provide cover for a fee. <br>
                    If an accident occurs during an event, you should take full details at the time of the incident, including the name and address of the injured person, the nature of the accident and where the accident occurred.
