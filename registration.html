            As the first touchpoint with your event, you should aim to have a smooth process to invite and register participants. A comprehensive invitation and registration timeline should include planning, implementation, sending of invitations, reminders, registration, confirmation and after the event a thank you note.

            <p class="paragraph-content">
                Define whom you want to invite and how, as well as how you get their contact information. Consider who can collect and manage the contacts throughout the invitation process, as it is usually quite time consuming. Define the segmentation of the invitees, as different registration forms and invitations are used for the different segments. Events may be invitation only or may be a combination of invited guests and registered attendees. When putting together an invitation list, you might want to think about inviting key representatives which align with IADT strategy, suggestions include:
                <p class="ul-title">Within IADT:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Governing Body Member</li>
                    <li>Executive Members</li> <!-- Link -->
                    <li>Senior Management</li> <!-- Link -->
                    <li> <!--"Heads of Faculty" Link -->, Heads of Department <!-- "FFACT" Link --> and <!-- "FEH" Link --></li>  
                    <li>Students Union</li> <!-- Link -->
                    <li>Internal Staff (contact your Faculty/Dept. Administrator)</li>
                    <li>Marketing</li> <!-- Link -->
                </ul>

                <p class="ul-title">External to IADT:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Industry Experts</li>
                    <li>Local Representatives</li>
                    <li>Alumni</li> <!-- Link -->
                    <li>Local schools & Further Education Providers</li> <!-- Link -->
                    <li>Community groups</li>
                    <li>Local Business Contacts</li>
                    <li>Councillors</li>
                </ul> 
                <br>

                Although each event will attract different guest numbers and exceptional circumstances (such as attendance by a notable VIP) can increase interest, you should plan for a 35% positive acceptance rate. Taking this figure into account, you should make sure you have an adequate invitation list to fill your event. 
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph-header">VIPs.</p>
            <p class="paragraph-content">
                If your audience is likely to include any dignitaries or external stakeholders of particular importance to IADT, it is important to inform your Presidents Office and Marketing. Distinguished guests would include politicians, business directors, etc but this list is not exhaustive.  Create a list of the distinguished guests including title and employment or position. Invitations to VIPs typically are sent from the President's Office.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph-header">Young people, children amd vulnerable adults.</p>
            <p class="paragraph-content">
                Events that attract an audience of children or vulnerable adults need to be given special consideration. <br>

            <p class="paragraph-header">Issuing invitations.</p>
            <p class="paragraph-content">
                When contacting the guests on your invitation list, consider the following: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Decide how you would like to send out your invitation: For formal events, printed invitations can be produced, for more information. For less formal, a pdf invitation can be attached to a personalised email.</li>
                    <li>Who is issuing the Invitation: Decide who the invitation will be from. Think about who is likely to have the greatest influence on your audience, e.g. President, Executive Member, Head of Faculty, Head of Department etc.</li>
                    <li>When & Where: Ensure that your invitation provides enough information to your guests in advance of the event. Give information regarding the timings, venue parking arrangements, dress code, etc.</li>
                    <li>RSVPs: Allocate an email account/phone number for responses and queries and ensure that all responses are accurately recorded on a spreadsheet or database to allow for the creation of table plans, delegate badges, etc.</li>
                    <li>Ask guests to provide dietary/mobility requirements at the point of RSVP to avoid the need for further contact.</li>
                    <li>Avoid sending invitations via mass email to avoid junk/ spam filters. Send in batches.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph-header">Registration System.</p>
            <p class="paragraph-content">
                Registration System. It is mandatory to use IADT's CRM system to collect registrations as we are required to report on events to HEA regardless of it being a free or paid event, internal or external. Payment functions are available. <br>

            <p class="paragraph-header">Privacy note.</p>
            <p class="paragraph-content">
                According to EU law it is mandatory to include in the invitation registration a link to privacy notice of IADT and contact details. Each event must have a designated and responsible contact person whom the guests may contact in case of any requests about their privacy. This contact information must be communicated in each event announcement and/or invitation. <br>

            <p class="paragraph-header">Data protection.</p>
            <p class="paragraph-content">
                Keep in mind GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). In order to fulfil the regulations, it is highly recommended to utilise the IADT Teams Forms or the IADT CRM Registration System. Any lists with personal information, e.g. contact information, cannot be stored or shared outside the core working group, nor on external platforms not recommended by IADT IT. All collected information must be stored securely and discarded immediately after completion of the event process. <br>

            <p class="paragraph-header">Collecting registrations.</p>
            <p class="paragraph-content">
                Whether your event is free or requires attendees to pay to attend, encouraging guests to register is a great way to anticipate attendance to inform room layouts, catering requirements, etc. If your event is free to attend, Eventbrite offers an easy-to-use, cost-free option to allow staff, students and the general public to register their intention to attend. An easy-to-follow guide to creating your event on IADT's CRM Registration System <!-- "XXX" 'insert reg system name' --> can be found here. <!-- "Contact Events" Link --> for information. <br>
                For larger academic conferences, the PCO (Professional Congress Organiser) usually collects registrations and payments. <br>

            <p class="paragraph-header">Frequently collected information.</p>
            <p class="paragraph-content">
                Define first what you really need to know about participants and only gather information that is needed for event purposes. The frequently collected information is usually first name, last name, email, dietary requirements. Do not collect any information not justified for the arranging of the event, e.g. age, gender, or address. <br> Data protection guidelines and GDPR are crucial when handling event registrations.
                IADT encourages data collection in:
                <ul>
                    <li>Green Campus, Carbon Emissions, modes of transport.</li>
                    <li>People and Inclusion, Equality Inclusion and Diversity.</li>
                    <li>Communications, Alumni Details and Future Student Details</li>

            <p class="paragraph-header">What Data and Why</p>
            <p class="paragraph-content">
                Don't forget to obtain permission for all the ways you will use their data by unbundling consent e.g. provide separate tick boxes for phone contact, contact by email and sharing with third parties like venues, sponsors and speakers. Third parties must be named. 
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph-header">Charging for registrations</p>
            <p class="paragraph-content">
                If you are charging for the registrations often an early bird offer attracts attendees, remember to send reminders. Make sure to outline what the registration includes. Ensure that the banking charge is included in the registration fee.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph-header">GDPR.</p>
            <p class="paragraph-content">
                It is vital for event organisers to understand the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) legislation and to understand the requirements. The legislation applies to everything from registration systems, event apps and surveys to social media, collecting business cards and scanning badges. If you print event data treat it as sensitive and be careful who has access to it outside of IADT. Please check with the event registration or event management platforms you use or the providers of any other apps or tech that use personal data and ask them to prove GDPR compliance.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph-header">Cleanse your data.</p>
            <p class="paragraph-content">
                Make sure all your existing data is clean by getting people to re-opt-in and destroying any data you can no longer use or that you don't need, this includes paper-based options.

            <p class="paragraph-header">Contact third parties.</p>
            <p class="paragraph-content">

            <p class="paragraph-header">Visa requirements.</p>
            <p class="paragraph-content">
                Delegates from some countries may require a visa supporting letter from the conference organiser. Where this is the case, you should ask them to email their request, stating their full name (as on their passport), address, country, passport number, nationality, travel dates and the date of the visa application to allow you to consider their request. Visa supporting letters should only be sent to delegates <b>after payment of the necessary conference registration fee</b>. For any further advice on visa requirements for attendees at events, please contact the Events team. <br>

When cancelled less than one month but more than ten (10) working days before the conference we will refund a percentage of 70% of the charge, unless the Conference or Event explicitly states that no refunds will be given. No refunds will be given for cancellation less than ten (10) working days before the conference or Event date or for non-attendance without notification, unless a refund is made entirely at the discretion of IADT.
