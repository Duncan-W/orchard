                Every event needs an audience. With the right message, you can attract the audience's attention. By utilising the tools supplied by IADT, you can market the event, both within the community and externally. Event marketing consists of targeting the right audience and a communication plan can help draft the relevant content for the channels.

                    <p class="paragraph-header">Communication plan.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph content">
                        Create a simple communication plan or checklist to market the event, including a timeline for different marketing & communication activities, target audiences, and channels. Use communication plan template to create your own plan. <br>

                        <p class="ul-title">Consider the steps below:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>100 words summary of your event - A small task but one that makes the rest of the journey easier. The synopsis describes your event on promotional materials and makes it easier for you to communicate with partners and colleagues as you go through planning.</li>
                            <li>Promotional channels within IADT - As well as your own network there might be other networks available. Depending on who your audience is talk to Marketing. The team do not always have capacity or operational responsibility to promote events outside their strategic activity plan but can point you in the right direction.</li>
                            <li>Promotional partner channels - If your event is in partnership, make sure to explore your partners' channels appropriately. They might have social media channels, blogs, or newsletters you can tap into.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p class="ul-title">You can effectively raise the profile of your event through the following means:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Let colleagues in IADT know by submitting information to Orchard.</li>
                            <li>IADT are always looking for interesting stories. These can then be paired with the registration details at the end of the post. This is often a better way to raise awareness of your event as the audience will engage with it on a human-interest level and then share the story with their followers.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p class="ul-title">Please note that not all events will be able to be featured, but all requests will be reviewed equally and selected in line with the current strategy. Things that the team are looking for can be:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Inspiring human-interest stories</li>
                            <li>Events which answer a need for staff / students / public</li>
                            <li>Inspiring experts who would be interested in creating a video with the team to talk about timely topics.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p class="paragraph-header">Diversity in Online Promotion.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph content">
                        Give consideration to the visible diversity of those appearing in promotion and formal event photos on social media and other online content pre- and post-event. Are they representative in terms of aspects such as: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Gender</li>

                            <li>Age and/or career stage</li>
                            <li>Disability</li>

                        The communication of the event should be planned accordingly. IADT's marketing team can only provide support if the event is related to IADT activities. They cannot support all events. It is recommended that you go through the communication plan and event content with the marketing team well in advance. Social media posts must be planned well in advance in co-operation with marketing. In larger and strategic events, news and media contacts are a vital part of the communications plan. <br>
