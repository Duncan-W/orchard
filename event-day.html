    <h1>Event Day</h1>
    <div class="header-content-box">
        <p class="header-box-paragraph">
            On the day of the event, follow your event timeline from set up, to event implementation, to clean up and take down. Great planning and communications with the event crew and volunteers are key for a successful event management. This phase concentrates on details around event set up, stage management, dismantling, and problem solving.

            <p class="paragraph-header">Final checks.</p>
            <p class="paragraph-content">
                In the week leading up to your event, take some time to double-check all of the details and confirm all previously made arrangements. Things to consider include:

                <ul>
                    <li>Confirm all room reservations and external supplier bookings.</li>
                    <li>Follow up on any outstanding RSVPs.</li>
                    <li>Confirm catering numbers and advise of any dietary requirements.</li>
                    <li>Check if any guests have requested special access requirements and make necessary arrangements.</li>
                    <li>Ensure you have all required printed materials (e.g. programmes, delegate badges, signage, etc).</li>
                    <li>Confirm arrangements and timings with event staff/assistants.</li>
                    <li>Request PowerPoint presentations in advance from any speaker and ensure they are working correctly with the equipment you intend to use. If using PowerPoint use 16:9 ratio.</li>
                    <li>By doing these checks 3-5 days before your event, you give yourself time to fix any problems that arise.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph-header">Material coordination.</p>
            <p class="paragraph-content">
                Have all materials ready at the beginning of the day and prepare for their delivery and storage, including checklists, contact lists, programme leaflets, staff passes, name badges, participation lists, prizes, presentation materials, etc. Consider the possible unpredicted need for additional materials: where do you have the original documents, where is the nearest printing station, etc.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph-header">Event crew management.</p>
            <p class="paragraph-content">
                Prepare a contact list for everyone in the event crew. Ensure that they arrive in good time prior to any attendees arriving. Hold a briefing prior to the start of the preparations. Decide and prepare a quick and clear means of communication (which device or app you use and who to contact). Distribute staff-passes, if used. Ensure that they are familiar with the format of the day, venues, special guest requirements, contingency plans and what to do in an emergency.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph-header">Contingency planning.</p>
            <p class="paragraph-content">
                Try to ensure that you have contingency plans in place for anything that may not go as planned on the day. Bring along spare delegate badges or table place names in case unexpected guests turn up and give consideration to what you will do in a range of situations, such as a speaker not turning up, a failure of AV equipment, or an emergency evacuation.  Ensure that all event staff are aware of contingency plans and what to do in an emergency. 
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph-header">Security</p>
            <p class="paragraph-content">
                For larger or special events, it is recommended that you hold a security briefing before the start of the preparations. Agree about this with the Event and Estates + Facilities well before the event. Invite all the core event team members to be present. All actual points of view, evacuation procedures etc. should be addressed here. Also agree on a means of communication, e.g. walkie talkies.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph-header">Health + Safety check.</p>
            <p class="paragraph-content">
                Ensure the accessibility of all the facilities. Check that the doorways and routes are free and unlocked during the event. Make sure that the exits are clear. Pay attention to furniture arrangements, leave pathways open, and use temporary signage if needed. Check pathways also during the setup and clear-up. Provide chairs or session leaders housekeeping notes e.g., fire alarm tests, evacuation routes, assembly points, etc. <br>

            <p class="paragraph-header">Signage</p>
            <p class="paragraph-content">
                Take some time to ensure that there is adequate signage for your guests to find their way around, especially if they are likely to be unfamiliar with the venue. Put yourself in the shoes of your attendees and walk around the venue, paying particular attention to wayfinding information for main event rooms, plenary rooms, catering venues and toilets. Set up signage, your first point of contact is the caretaker's desk.

            <p class="paragraph-header">Cleaning.</p>
            <p class="paragraph-content">
                Rooms are cleaned daily. Check that the cleaning is done according to your requirements in all the requested facilities. Your event may be one of a number of uses of the room over a day. Please plan in advance if the room needs advance cleaning and if you think the room will need cleaning after your event.  Contact catering to ask for food, snacks, and drinks to be removed at the end of the day. They should not remain in rooms over night or over a weekend.  
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph-header">Cloakroom.</p>

            <p class="paragraph-content">
                What happens, when, who, where, and what tech will be needed? Make or finalise an event timetable to the minute, including all necessary technical details. Share it with the event crew. Everyone included in the programme should have a printout of the event's programme at hand. <br>

            <p class="paragraph-header">Programme.</p>
            <p class="paragraph-content">
                Decide how the programme is being shared with participants, speakers, or within the venue in general. Prefer digital platforms over handouts.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph-header">Briefing.</p>
            <p class="paragraph-content">
                Take time to brief hosts, speakers, and performers, as well as everyone working with the event, whether on payroll or volunteering.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph-header">Presentation materials.</p>
            <p class="paragraph-content">
                Presentation materials such as PPT slides and videos should always be requested, collected, and revised beforehand. Prepare and use dividers with IADT branding or that of the event. Have all the materials, preferably as a single file, on a separate computer or memory stick, or share the file with the technical crew. Required adapters and clickers should be arranged and collected beforehand, too. <!-- "Contact IT" 'Who is the IT contact?' Yes, who indeed... Link -->.

            <p class="paragraph-header">Soundcheck and technical.</p>
            <p class="paragraph-content">
                This must be scheduled after the technical set-up. Speakers and technical staff will check the microphones. Final rehearsals require more time especially if there are music performances. Also check the internet connection and presentations. If you do not have professional technical staff present, decide beforehand who will monitor the sound and who will take action if something fails.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph-header">Permission to distribute and publish.</p>
            <p class="paragraph-content">
                For video recordings, webcasts, pictures, etc., you always need to have proper permissions. Check that you have the permissions well in advance from the speakers and performers. Check that participants are informed about photographing taking place during the event through your event communications channels and signage on location.

            <p class="paragraph-header">Risk analysis.</p>
            <p class="paragraph-content">
                The smoothness and security of an event is strongly influenced by good planning and recognising potential risks. It is advisable to be prepared for unexpected situations in advance by defining responsibilities, i.e., who is involved with what, who is contacted about what, who is responsible for communicating with the event crew and the guests, and so on. To be able to do this, always check operational readiness, roles, and responsibilities as well as list the relevant contact information. <br>

            <p class="paragraph-header">On-call duty at the event.</p>
            <p class="paragraph-content">
                It is recommended to have an appointed contact person or persons at the event, who will take care of smaller urgent matters such as power outage, changes in catering, late speakers etc. For example, the persons working at the registration desk can be appointed to this role.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph-header">Emergency procedures.</p>
            <p class="paragraph-content">
                For greater urgent matters or accidents always refer to the security plan of the venue and/or the event, and general emergency number. Issues requiring immediate attention due to the nature of the issue (such as health and safety) should be communicated as soon as possible either by email <!-- "caretakersdesk@iadt.ie" Link --> or from the campus, phoning ext. 4660 or +353 1 239 4660 if you are using a personal phone. <br>
                Note that the person marked as contact person in the security plan must always be on site throughout the event and is the primary contact in urgent emergency matters inside the event organisation. Read also through general emergency instructions. All media contacts are handled by the Institutes Communications director. When you encounter a near miss, accident, or an incident, make a report to the incident reporting system. <br>

            <p class="paragraph-content">
                Event organisers can witness a wide range of human behaviour, unreasonable demands, and new experiences. Take note of past events and learn from surprising situations. Remember also that you cannot please everybody, but you can keep calm and ask for help if needed. Do your best, carry on, and never stop learning.
